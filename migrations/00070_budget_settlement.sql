-- Budget settlement off the hot row (ADR-0015, part 1). An outcome no
-- longer updates the budget account or counter row: it records the
-- reservation COMMITTED or RELEASED and pending. A background job applies
-- pending reservations to their rows in batches, one update per row, and
-- clears pending in the same transaction. Until then the row counts a
-- pending reservation as reserved, which can only make a budget look more
-- consumed than it is: a commit moves an amount from reserved to spent, and
-- a release lowers reserved. Views that show a budget add the pending ones
-- (reserved minus pending, spent plus pending commits). The sweep lister
-- gets a budget_settle purpose: orgs with pending reservations (HR-054),
-- added to its definition from 00065_checkpoints. It reached main after
-- M7's 00060-00066; M7 migrations still to come take 00071 and later, and
-- any that redefines the lister starts from this definition.
